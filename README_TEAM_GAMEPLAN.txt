================================WORK For Ram==============================================


1)  Doc 2 Vec , get another 2 text sets with a different label, and hardcode it into the py file 

2) preprocess with dependency parsing

a) Need to only keep nouns and adjectives. Maybe only nouns !!
  Test getTaggedDocumentsWithNounsOnly
b) Need another two corpus

-------DONE WORK

1) Use NLTK wordnet lexicon and see if you can identify aspects better ? review the plan in the text file
