a) The choice of seed words for the unsupervised approach was taken from
the following information and logic

Find the adjective
qualifying the aspect. Then apply the dictionary search. Can also be an adverb , if the aspect is the noun subject eg: food is great.

NOTE: if no amod or nsubj connection, find the nearest JJ that has the "head" as the aspect and not connected to anything else
IMPORTANT: Can be "little perks were great" little is amod, so is great. Read through and id all JJ with nsubj as aspect.

NOTE: if the aspect is not literally there in the sentence, then this approach cannot work

NOTE: if the adj is not linked in DEPS tags, then look for the adjectives around the aspect word,
IMPORTANT: look for negation words with 2 words before it ? Or can you use the tree?

dictionary search: Get the definition, do dependency parsing.
        Then for each adjective, 
            a) see if it is negated. 
            b) get the lemma form and see if it is in the assoc list
            c) if the words in the association list appear directly in the definition.
                    also be careful of negations "without pleasure" , "no satisfaction" ,"not good"
                    I think those are all the words
            d) If we could not find adjectives for the aspect, then it is neutral
