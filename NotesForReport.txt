1) NLTK and wordnet did not work as the definitions of laptop and restaurant was inadequate. There were no hyper and
hyponyms, or meronyms and holonyms for the categories. So it was impossible to evaluate associations with the words
in the reviews.

  REference the paper and say it was suggested, but very noisy in the number of bad nouns that you get from the many definitions
  
  2) If doc 2 vec is used, need to specify how to install gensim. Either pip or conda
  
 
 3) The wordnet approach for polarity depended on finding the right adjective, lemmatizing properly, and having
 the right seed set of words. 
 
  Much easier to use training data for seed words.
